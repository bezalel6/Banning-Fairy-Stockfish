# Ban Chess Implementation Verification

## Position Analysis
After moves: 1.e4 e6 2.Qh5 a5
White to move from position with Queen on h5

## Move: 3.Qxf7+
This move gives check to the Black king.

## Critical Logic in search_banchess (lines 2004-2011):
```cpp
// After our move, check if we can force checkmate by banning opponent's only move
if (legalOppMoves == 1 && pos.checkers()) {
    value = VALUE_MATE - ss->ply; // We win immediately by banning their only escape
}
```

## Evaluation Flow:
1. White plays Qxf7+ (giving check)
2. Engine counts Black's legal moves: **1** (only Kxf7)
3. Engine detects Black is in check: **YES** (from Queen on f7)
4. Condition met: `legalOppMoves == 1 && pos.checkers()`
5. Returns: `VALUE_MATE` (checkmate value)

## Why This Should Work:
- When evaluating Qxf7+ at the root, the engine will:
  1. Make the move Qxf7+
  2. Count opponent's legal moves (finds only Kxf7)
  3. Detect opponent is in check
  4. Return VALUE_MATE score for this move
  5. This mate score should make Qxf7+ the best move

## Implementation Locations:
- **Root move evaluation**: lines 1983-2027 in search.cpp
- **Checkmate detection**: lines 2004-2011
- **Ban Chess variant check**: lines 450-460
- **StateInfo ban tracking**: position.h line 59

The logic is correct. The engine SHOULD choose Qxf7+ as it leads to immediate checkmate via banning the only escape move.
