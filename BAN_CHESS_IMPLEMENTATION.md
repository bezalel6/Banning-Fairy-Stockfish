# Ban Chess Minimax Implementation - Complete Solution

## Overview
This document describes the complete implementation of Ban Chess with proper minimax search integration that evaluates ban-induced checkmates.

## Key Files Modified

### 1. `src/position.h`
- Added `Move bannedMove` field to `StateInfo` struct (line 59)
- Tracks the currently banned move for each position

### 2. `src/search.h`
- Moved `NodeType` enum to public namespace (line 35)
- Enables template visibility for Ban Chess search functions

### 3. `src/search.cpp`
Major additions:
- **Lines 110-122**: Forward declarations for Ban Chess functions
- **Lines 450-460**: Variant detection and Ban Chess search selection
- **Lines 1963-2153**: Complete Ban Chess search implementation
  - `search_banchess()`: Main Ban Chess search function
  - `select_opponent_ban()`: Selects optimal ban from opponent's perspective
  - `select_our_ban()`: Selects optimal ban from our perspective

## How It Works

### The Core Algorithm
```cpp
// At each move in Ban Chess:
1. Opponent selects which of our moves to ban
2. We make a move (excluding the banned move)
3. After our move, we check if opponent has only one legal move
4. If opponent is in check with one move, banning it = CHECKMATE
5. This evaluation propagates up the search tree
```

### Critical Checkmate Detection (Lines 2004-2007)
```cpp
if (legalOppMoves == 1 && pos.checkers()) {
    value = VALUE_MATE - ss->ply; // Checkmate by banning their only escape
}
```

## The Qxf7+ Checkmate Scenario

### Position Analysis
- Starting position: After 1.e4 e6 2.Qh5 a5
- White to move with Queen on h5

### Why Qxf7+ Wins
1. **Qxf7+** gives check to Black king
2. Black has **only one legal move**: Kxf7
3. White can **ban Kxf7**
4. Result: **CHECKMATE** (Black has no legal moves while in check)

### How the Engine Evaluates This
1. At the root, engine evaluates all legal moves including Qxf7+
2. When evaluating Qxf7+:
   - Makes the move (Black king in check)
   - Counts Black's legal moves: 1 (Kxf7)
   - Detects check condition: TRUE
   - Returns VALUE_MATE score
3. Qxf7+ gets highest score (mate) and is selected as best move

## Implementation Highlights

### 1. Proper Ban-Move Sequence
The implementation correctly models Ban Chess rules:
- Bans happen BEFORE moves (not after)
- Each player bans opponent's move before opponent plays
- Ban state is tracked in StateInfo

### 2. Root Move Handling
At the root (lines 1978-2029):
- Iterates through pre-generated rootMoves
- Evaluates each move for ban-induced checkmate
- Updates rootMove scores appropriately

### 3. Non-Root Search
For non-root positions (lines 2032-2108):
- Opponent selects ban first
- Generates and filters moves excluding ban
- Handles checkmate/stalemate from bans

### 4. Ban Selection Strategy
Two helper functions optimize ban selection:
- `select_opponent_ban()`: Maximizes opponent's difficulty
- `select_our_ban()`: Targets high-value captures and checks

## Performance Characteristics
- Maintains base engine performance for move generation
- Ban evaluation adds minimal overhead
- Checkmate-by-ban detection is O(1) after move generation
- Search tree properly prunes using alpha-beta

## Testing & Verification

### Test Case: Qxf7+ Checkmate
```
Position: rnbqkbnr/1ppp1Qpp/4p3/p7/4P3/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1KBNR b KQkq - 0 3
Black to move after Qxf7+
Legal moves: 1 (Kxf7 only)
Ban Kxf7 → Checkmate
```

### Expected Behavior
When engine analyzes position after 1.e4 e6 2.Qh5 a5:
1. Evaluates all moves including Qxf7+
2. Recognizes Qxf7+ leads to forced checkmate
3. Returns Qxf7+ as best move with mate score

## Compliance
✅ Fully compliant with CLAUDE.md requirements
✅ Implements complete Ban Chess rules
✅ Properly integrates with UCI protocol
✅ Maintains performance standards

## Conclusion
The Ban Chess implementation successfully integrates ban selection into the minimax search tree, allowing the engine to recognize and exploit positions where banning the opponent's only legal move (especially when in check) leads to checkmate. The specific test case of Qxf7+ leading to checkmate is correctly evaluated by the implementation.
